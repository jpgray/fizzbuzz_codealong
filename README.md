# fizzbuzz_codealong

As early practice for using Rspec in ruby, Engineering 20 together create a fizzbuzz program designed to be easily testable, and created appropriate tests.
The program itself will list numbers for a given range, and replace numbers that are divisible by 3 with "fizz", divisible by 5 with "buzz" and divisible by both with "fizzbuzz"
